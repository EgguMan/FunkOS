# Subtitle Event

## What is it?

The subtitle event is an event that will show subtitles above the healthbar. Its inputs are V1(Text to display) and V2(options)

## How to use?

The subtitle event a lot more simple than it may seem! The options follows Shader Operation Standard, but is formatted as this `font, ui, width, 350`. The options are as follows

`font` - can be ui to use Paths.uiFont
`width`
`mainColor`
`borderColor`
`scale` or `size`
`introtime`
`persistTime` or `time`

each value can be blank, and it will assume a default.

# Trail Event

## What is it?

The Trail event will apply a FlxTrail to a character, or object if called by source. Its inputs are a V1 (target, or operation) and V2 (options)

## How to use

If you want to apply the trail to a character, you can use the table below to see how to format character names (generated by https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

| Boyfriend | Opponent | Girlfriend |
|:---------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|     bf    |    dad   |     gf     | 
| boyfriend | opponent | girlfriend |
| bop fiend |     1    |      2     |
|     0     |          |            |

Value 1 can also be an operation, in 1.0 the only operations avalible are destroy, kill, and remove. you can only do this to the last valid shader, so if you've destroyed or removed the last shader it will destroy, kill, or remove the one before it.

Value 2 can be blank, but, the values represent the input values of the trail, in this order - length, delay, alpha, diff. If you dont get what those are, read [this](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/addons/effects/FlxTrail.html), the entire field can be left blank to assume defaults, but leaving individual fields blank will not work, you need to input a non-number or a number.
